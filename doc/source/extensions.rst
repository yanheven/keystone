==========
Extensions
==========

Status
======

An extension may be considered ``stable``, ``experimental`` or ``out-of-tree``.

* A `stable` status indicates that an extension is fully supported by the
  OpenStack Identity team.

* An `experimental` status indicates that although the intention is to keep
  the API unchanged, we reserve the right to change it up until the point that
  it is deemed `stable`.

* An `out-of-tree` status indicates that no formal support will be provided.

Graduation Process
==================

By default, major new functionality that is proposed to be in-tree will start
off in `experimental` status. Typically it would take at minimum of one cycle
to transition from `experimental` to `stable`, although in special cases this
might happened within a cycle.

Removal Process
===============

It is not intended that functionality should stay in experimental for a long
period, functionality that stays `experimental` for more than **two** releases
would be expected to make a transition to either `stable` or `out-of-tree`.

Current Extensions
==================

------------------
Endpoint Filtering
------------------

The Endpoint Filtering extension enables creation of ad-hoc catalogs for each
project-scoped token request.

.. NOTE:: Support status for Endpoint Filtering

---------------
Endpoint Policy
---------------

The Endpoint Policy extension provides associations between service endpoints
and policies that are already stored in the Identity server and referenced by
a policy ID.

----------
Federation
----------

The Federation extension provides the ability for users to manage Identity
Providers (IdPs) and establish a set of rules to map federation protocol
attributes to Identity API attributes.

-------
Inherit
-------

The Inherit extension provides the ability for projects to inherit role
assignments from their owning domain, or from projects higher in the
hierarchy.

.. NOTE:: Support status for Inherit

   *Experimental* (Havava, Icehouse)
   *Stable* (Juno)

----------
OAuth 1.0a
----------

The OAuth 1.0a extension provides the ability for Identity users to delegate
roles to third party consumers via the OAuth 1.0a specification.

.. NOTE:: Support status for OAuth 1.0a

   *Experimental* (Havana, Icehouse)
   *Stable* (Juno)

-----------------
Revocation Events
-----------------

The Revocation Events extension provides a list of token revocations. Each
event expresses a set of criteria which describes a set of tokens that are
no longer valid.

.. NOTE:: Support status for Revocation Events

   *Experimental* (Juno)
   *Stable* (Kilo)

Enabling the Endpoint Filter Extension
======================================

To enable the endpoint filter extension:

1. Add the endpoint filter extension catalog driver to the ``[catalog]`` section
   in ``keystone.conf``. For example::

    [catalog]
    driver = keystone.contrib.endpoint_filter.backends.catalog_sql.EndpointFilterCatalog

2. Add the ``endpoint_filter_extension`` filter to the ``api_v3`` pipeline in
   ``keystone-paste.ini``. This must be added after ``json_body`` and before
   the last entry in the pipeline. For example::

    [pipeline:api_v3]
    pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension simple_cert_extension revoke_extension endpoint_filter_extension service_v3

3. Create the endpoint filter extension tables if using the provided sql backend. For example::

    ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension endpoint_filter

4. Optionally, change ``return_all_endpoints_if_no_filter`` the ``[endpoint_filter]`` section
   in ``keystone.conf`` to return an empty catalog if no associations are made. For example::

    [endpoint_filter]
    return_all_endpoints_if_no_filter = False

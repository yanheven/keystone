Enabling the Endpoint Policy Extension
======================================

To enable the endpoint policy extension:

1. Optionally, add the endpoint policy extension driver to the
   ``[endpoint_policy]`` section in ``keystone.conf``. For example::

    [endpoint_policy]
    driver = keystone.contrib.endpoint_policy.backends.sql.EndpointPolicy

2. Add the ``endpoint_policy_extension`` policy to the ``api_v3`` pipeline in
   ``keystone-paste.ini``. This must be added after ``json_body`` and before
   the last entry in the pipeline. For example::

    [pipeline:api_v3]
    pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension simple_cert_extension revoke_extension service_v3 endpoint_policy_extension service_v3

3. Create the endpoint policy extension tables if using the provided SQL backend. For example::

    ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension endpoint_policy

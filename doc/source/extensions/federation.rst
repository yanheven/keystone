==================================
Enabling the Federation Extension
==================================

To enable the federation extension:

1. Add the federation extension driver to the ``[federation]`` section in
   ``keystone.conf``. For example::

       [federation]
       driver = keystone.contrib.federation.backends.sql.Federation

2. Add the ``saml2`` and/or ``oidc`` authentication methods to the ``[auth]``
   section in ``keystone.conf``::

       [auth]
       methods = external,password,token,saml2,oidc
       saml2 = keystone.auth.plugins.mapped.Mapped
       oidc = keystone.auth.plugins.mapped.Mapped

.. NOTE::
    The ``external`` method should be dropped to avoid any interference with
    some Apache + Shibboleth SP setups, where a ``REMOTE_USER`` env variable is
    always set, even as an empty value.

3. Add the ``federation_extension`` middleware to the ``api_v3`` pipeline in
   ``keystone-paste.ini``. This must be added after ``json_body`` and before
   the last entry in the pipeline. For example::

       [pipeline:api_v3]
       pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension simple_cert_extension revoke_extension federation_extension service_v3

4. Create the federation extension tables if using the provided SQL backend.
   For example::

       ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension federation

5. As of the Juno release, multiple Keystone deployments can now be federated.
   To do so, the `pysaml2 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysaml2>`_ library is
   required. Since OS-FEDERATION is an extension, ``pysaml2`` is not installed
   by default, it must be installed manually. For example::

        pip install --upgrade $(grep pysaml2 test-requirements.txt)

   Also, the `xmlsec1` command line tool is needed to sign the SAML assertions
   generated by the Keystone Identity Provider:

   .. code-block:: bash

        $ apt-get install xmlsec1

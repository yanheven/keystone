Enabling the OAuth1 Extension
=============================

To enable the OAuth1 extension:

1. Optionally, add the oauth1 extension driver to the ``[oauth1]`` section in ``keystone.conf``. For example::

    [oauth1]
    driver = keystone.contrib.oauth1.backends.sql.OAuth1

2. Add the ``oauth1`` authentication method to the ``[auth]`` section in ``keystone.conf``::

    [auth]
    methods = external,password,token,oauth1
    oauth1 = keystone.auth.plugins.oauth1.OAuth

3. Add the ``oauth1_extension`` filter to the ``api_v3`` pipeline in
   ``keystone-paste.ini``. This must be added after ``json_body`` and before
   the last entry in the pipeline. For example::

    [pipeline:api_v3]
    pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension simple_cert_extension revoke_extension oauth1_extension service_v3

4. Create the OAuth1 extension tables if using the provided SQL backend. For example::

    ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension oauth1

5. Optionally, if deploying under an HTTPD server (i.e. Apache), set the
   `WSGIPassAuthorization` to allow the OAuth Authorization headers to
   pass through `mod_wsgi`. For example, add the following to the Keystone
   virtual host file::

    WSGIPassAuthorization On

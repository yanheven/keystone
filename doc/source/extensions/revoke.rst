=================================
Enabling the Revocation Extension
=================================

.. NOTE::

    As of the Juno release, the example configuration files will have the
    ``OS-REVOKE`` extension enabled by default, thus it is not necessary to
    perform steps 1 and 2.
    Also, for new installations, the revocation extension tables are already
    migrated, thus it is not necessary to perform steps 3.

1. Optionally, add the revoke extension driver to the ``[revoke]`` section
   in ``keystone.conf``. For example::

    [revoke]
    driver = keystone.contrib.revoke.backends.sql.Revoke

2. Add the required ``filter`` to the ``pipeline`` in ``keystone-paste.ini``.
   This must be added after ``json_body`` and before the last entry in the
   pipeline. For example::

    [filter:revoke_extension]
    paste.filter_factory = keystone.contrib.revoke.routers:RevokeExtension.factory

    [pipeline:api_v3]
    pipeline = sizelimit url_normalize build_auth_context token_auth admin_token_auth json_body ec2_extension_v3 s3_extension simple_cert_extension revoke_extension service_v3

3. Create the revocation extension tables if using the provided SQL backend.
   For example::

    ./bin/keystone-manage db_sync --extension revoke

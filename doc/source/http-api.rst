HTTP API
========

Specifications
==============

Keystone implements two major HTTP API versions, along with several API
extensions that build on top of each core API. The two APIs are specified as
`Identity API v2.0`_ and `Identity API v3`_. Each API is specified by a single
source of truth to avoid conflicts between documentation and implementation.
The original source of truth for the v2.0 API is defined by a set of WADL and
XSD files. The original source of truth for the v3 API is defined by
documentation.

.. _`Identity API v2.0`: https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/tree/master/v2.0/src
.. _`Identity API v3`: https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/tree/master/v3/src/markdown

History
=======

You're probably wondering why Keystone does not implement a "v1" API. As a
matter of fact, one exists, but it actually predates OpenStack. The v1.x API
was an extremely small API documented and implemented by Rackspace for their
early public cloud products.

With the advent of OpenStack, Keystone served to provide a superset of the
authentication and multi-tenant authorization models already implemented by
Rackspace's public cloud, Nova, and Swift. Thus, Identity API v2.0 was
introduced.

Identity API v3 was established to introduce namespacing for users and projects
by using "domains" as a higher-level container for more flexible identity
management and fixed a security issue in the v2.0 API (bearer tokens appearing
in URLs).

Should I use v2.0 or v3?
========================

Identity API v3.

Identity API v3 is a superset of all the functionality available in v2.0 and
several of its extensions, and provides a much more consistent developer
experience to boot. We're also on the road to deprecating, and ultimately
reducing (or dropping) support for, Identity API v2.0.

How do I migrate from v2.0 to v3?
=================================

I am a deployer
---------------

You'll need to ensure the v3 API is included in your Paste pipeline, usually
``etc/keystone-paste.ini``. Our `latest sample configuration`_ includes the v3
application pipeline.

First define a v3 application, which refers to the v3 application factory
method:

.. code-block:: ini

    [app:service_v3]
    paste.app_factory = keystone.service:v3_app_factory

Then define a v3 pipeline, which terminates with the v3 application you defined
above:

.. code-block:: ini

    [app:app_v3]
    pipeline = ... service_v3

Replace "..." with whatever middleware you'd like to run in front of the API
service. Our `latest sample configuration`_ documents our tested
recommendations, but your requirements may vary.

Finally, include the v3 pipeline in at least one ``composite`` application (but
usually both ``[composite:main]`` and ``[composite:admin]``), for example:

.. code-block:: ini

    [composite:main]
    use = egg:Paste#urlmap
    /v3 = api_v3
    ...

Once your pipeline is configured to expose both v2.0 and v3, you need to ensure
that you've configured your service catalog in Keystone correctly. The
simplest, and most ideal, configuration would expose one identity with
unversioned endpoints (note the lack of ``/v2.0/`` or ``/v3/`` in these URLs):

- Service (type: ``identity``)

  - Endpoint (interface: ``public``, URL: ``http://identity:5000/``)
  - Endpoint (interface: ``admin``, URL: ``http://identity:35357/``)

If you were to perform a ``GET`` against either of these endpoints, you would
be greeted by an ``HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices`` response, which newer
Keystone clients can use to automatically detect available API versions.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -i http://identity:35357/
    HTTP/1.1 300 Multiple Choices
    Vary: X-Auth-Token
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 755
    Date: Tue, 10 Jun 2014 14:22:26 GMT

    {"versions": {"values": [ ... ]}}

With unversioned ``identity`` endpoints in the service catalog, you should be
able to `authenticate with keystoneclient`_ successfully.

.. _`latest sample configuration`: https://github.com/openstack/keystone/blob/master/etc/keystone-paste.ini
.. _`authenticate with keystoneclient`: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/python-keystoneclient/using-api-v3.html#authenticating

I have a Python client
----------------------

The Keystone community provides first-class support for Python API consumers
via our client library, `python-keystoneclient`_. If you're not currently using
this library, you should, as it is intended to expose all of our HTTP API
functionality. If we're missing something you're looking for, please
contribute!

Adopting `python-keystoneclient`_ should be the easiest way to migrate to
Identity API v3.

.. _`python-keystoneclient`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-keystoneclient/

I have a non-Python client
--------------------------

You'll likely need to heavily reference our `API documentation`_ to port your
application to Identity API v3.

.. _`API documentation`: https://github.com/openstack/identity-api/blob/master/v3/src/markdown/identity-api-v3.md

The most common operation would be password-based authentication including a
tenant name (i.e. project name) to specify an authorization scope. In Identity
API v2.0, this would be a request to ``POST /v2.0/tokens``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "auth": {
            "passwordCredentials": {
                "password": "my-password",
                "username": "my-username"
            },
            "tenantName": "project-x"
        }
    }

And you would get back a JSON blob with an ``access`` -> ``token`` -> ``id``
that you could pass to another web service as your ``X-Auth-Token`` header
value.

In Identity API v3, an equivalent request would be to ``POST /v3/auth/tokens``:

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "auth": {
            "identity": {
                "methods": [
                    "password"
                ],
                "password": {
                    "user": {
                        "domain": {
                            "id": "default"
                        },
                        "name": "my-username",
                        "password": "my-password"
                    }
                }
            },
            "scope": {
                "project": {
                    "domain": {
                        "id": "default"
                    },
                    "name": "project-x"
                }
            }
        }
    }

Note a few key differences when compared to the v2.0 API:

- A "tenant" in v2.0 became a "project" in v3.
- The authentication method (``password``) is explicitly identified.
- Both the user name (``my-username``) and project name (``project-x``) are
  namespaced by an owning domain (where ``id`` = ``default``). The "default"
  domain exists by default in Keystone, and automatically owns the namespace
  exposed by Identity API v2.0. Alternatively, you may reference users and
  projects that exist outside the namespace of the default domain, which are
  thus inaccessible to the v2.0 API.
- In v3, your token is returned to you in an ``X-Subject-Token`` header,
  instead of as part of the request body. You should still authenticate
  yourself to other services using the ``X-Auth-Token`` header.


HTTP/1.1 Chunked Encoding
=========================
.. WARNING::

    Running Keystone under HTTPD in the recommended (and tested) configuration does not support
    the use of ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``. This is due to a limitation with the WSGI spec
    and the implementation used by ``mod_wsgi``. Support for chunked encoding under ``eventlet``
    may or may not continue. It is recommended that all clients assume Keystone will not support
    ``Transfer-Encoding: chunked``.

Welcome to Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service!
====================================================

Keystone is an OpenStack project that provides Identity, Token, Catalog and
Policy services for use specifically by projects in the OpenStack family.
It implements `OpenStack's Identity API`_.

This document describes Keystone for contributors of the project, and assumes
that you are already familiar with Keystone from an `end-user perspective`_.

.. _`OpenStack's Identity API`: http://specs.openstack.org/openstack/keystone-specs/
.. _`end-user perspective`: http://docs.openstack.org/

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the source
tree. Also see the :doc:`community` page for other ways to interact with the
community.

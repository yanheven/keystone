    It is usually configured via config entries that look like:

      catalog.$REGION.$SERVICE.$key = $value

    and is stored in a similar looking hierarchy. Where a value can contain
    values to be interpolated by standard python string interpolation that look
    like (the % is replaced by a $ due to paste attempting to interpolate on
    its own:

      http://localhost:$(public_port)s/

    When expanding the template it will pass in a dict made up of the conf
    instance plus a few additional key-values, notably tenant_id and user_id.

    It does not care what the keys and values are but it is worth noting that
    keystone_compat will expect certain keys to be there so that it can munge
    them into the output format keystone expects. These keys are:

      name - the name of the service, most likely repeated for all services of
             the same type, across regions.

      adminURL - the url of the admin endpoint

      publicURL - the url of the public endpoint

      internalURL - the url of the internal endpoint
